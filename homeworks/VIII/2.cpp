// （2）Define the internal path length for a tree as the sum of the depths of all internal nodes, 
// while the external path length is the sum of the depths of all leaf nodes in the tree. 
// Prove by induction that if tree T is a full binary tree with n internal nodes, 
// I is T’s internal path length, and E is T’s external path length, then E = I + 2n for n≥0
